# MachineLearning

A small machine learning experiment created completely from scratch in Java. This project was primarily motivated by my desire to understand the underlying mathematics behind basic machine learning rather than focusing on creating the most impressive model.  The program uses an RBF network to perform the classic machine learning "hello world" task of classifying iris flowers based on their dimensions. I experimented with differnet training methods, such as a simple hill climbing algorithm and a more complex simulated annealing algorithm.
